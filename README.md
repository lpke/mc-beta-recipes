# mc-beta-recipes

This minecraft datapack removes _all_ default recipes using `filter` in
`pack.mcmeta`. This is to ensure no recipe collisions and to remove all modern
recipes, leaving only their beta counterparts from this pack.

There are a few changes/workarounds to make the experience with modern minecraft
pleasant. Variations from pure Beta recipes are listed below:

## Crafting

* Crafting slabs still yields 6 items instead of 3 (which was the case in Beta)
* Smooth stone slabs can be created with either:
  * 3 stone - yielding only 3 slabs
  * 3 smooth stone - yielding the full 6 slabs
* The following items work as dyes, and can also be crafted into their dye
counterparts (and crafted back):
  * Cocoa Beans / Brown Dye
  * Ink Sac / Black Dye
  * Bonemeal / White Dye
  * Lapis Lazuli / Blue Dye

## Smelting

* Allow cooking raw beef
* Allow smelting stone into smooth stone

# mc-beta-recipes

This minecraft datapack removes _all_ default recipes using `filter` in
`pack.mcmeta`. This is to ensure no recipe collisions and to remove all modern
recipes, leaving only their Beta 1.7.3 counterparts from this pack.

There are a few changes/workarounds to make the experience with modern minecraft
pleasant. Variations from pure Beta 1.7.3 recipes are listed below:

## Crafting

* Allow basic item repair (using same tools)
* Allow crafting oak buttons
* The following items work as dyes, and can also be crafted into their dye
counterparts (and crafted back):
  * Cocoa Beans / Brown Dye
  * Ink Sac / Black Dye
  * Bonemeal / White Dye
  * Lapis Lazuli / Blue Dye
* Crafting slabs still yields 6 items instead of 3 (which was the case in Beta)
* Sign recipe outputs 3 signs instead of 1
* Door recipe outputs 3 signs instead of 1
* Flint and Steel, Mushroom Stew, and Chest/Furnace Minecarts remain as
shapeless recipes
* Buttons are crafted with a single item (instead of 2)
* Golden Apples are crafted with gold ingots (instead of Gold Blocks)

## Smelting

* Allow cooking raw beef
* Allow smelting stone into smooth stone
